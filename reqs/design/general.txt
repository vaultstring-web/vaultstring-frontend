IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES FOR TEAM
Component Development Principles:
Atomic Design: Build from atoms → molecules → organisms → templates

Composition: Prefer compound components over monolithic ones

Accessibility First: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

Mobile-First: Design for mobile, enhance for desktop

Performance: Lazy load non-critical components, optimize images

State Management Strategy:
Server State: TanStack Query for API data

Client State: Zustand for UI state (or Redux Toolkit if preferred)

Form State: React Hook Form with Zod validation

Auth State: Context/provider pattern with persistent sessions


Testing Strategy:
Unit tests for components and utilities

Integration tests for critical user flows (auth, onboarding, transfer)

E2E tests for happy paths with Cypress or Playwright
